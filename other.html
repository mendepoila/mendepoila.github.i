<h1>My favorite places in Karaganda</h1>
<p>top 3 must-visit places for tourists</p>
<p>1.The Central Park of Culture and Recreation in Karaganda was officially opened in 1946 and has been a favorite place for the citizens ever since. On its territory, there are walking alleys, an artificial lake, cafes, children's attractions, and a concert hall. The latter often hosts concerts and performances. </p>
<p>2.Regional Central Mosque -  is an amazing building that makes the visitor feel to be in a different country. Must visit in Karaganda.</p>
<p>3.Independence Stele - Nice monument which replaced the monument of Lenin. The monument is located in front of Akimat building (city governor). Across the road you can find cascade fountains.</p>
